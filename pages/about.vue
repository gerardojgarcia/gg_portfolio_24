          Hi! My name is Gerardo! I am a full stack developer specializing in SSR
          frameworks like Nuxt.js and Laravel. I decided to work with a Vue.js because it
          the most intuitive framework for me - the Options API just clicked with me. I
          have since moved on to the Composition API and really enjoy just have clean and
          streamlined my files end up being. I really prefer to have my sites built with
          components - it makes it a lot easier to work with as a project grows in
          complexity.
