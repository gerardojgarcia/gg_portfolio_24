            Hi! My name is Gerardo! I am a full stack developer specializing in SSR
            frameworks like Nuxt.js and Laravel.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got my start in development by putting together an entire online presence
            for a small cleaning business, Oranges and Lemons.these were all "no-code"
            solutions: website built on Weebly, zapier to make connections to our customer
            database, and cleaning management software. These technologies allowed us to
            provide an absolutely painfree and modern way of getting a cleaning service.
            Clients could access the website to get information, generate a custom quote,
            and be forwared to a payment processor. Investing in features like sms
            notifation updates, live tracking of cleaning, in-app invoicing allowed us to
            stand out from the competition. The website design and feautures were used to
            process over $1 million USD in sales.
