        HTML - The Architect of the Web HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, serves as the
        fundamental building block of any web page. It provides the structure, defining
        elements such as headings, paragraphs, and images. Learning HTML is akin to
        understanding the blueprint of a house â€” an essential foundation on which the
        entire structure is built. CSS - Adding Style and Elegance Cascading Style Sheets
        (CSS) is the designer's toolkit, allowing you to enhance the visual appeal of your
        web pages. With CSS, you can control layout, colors, and fonts, transforming a
        simple HTML structure into a visually stunning and user-friendly interface.
        JavaScript - Bringing Interactivity to Life JavaScript breathes life into the
        static world of HTML and CSS. As a scripting language, it enables dynamic content,
        interactivity, and responsiveness. From form validations to creating dynamic
        elements, JavaScript is the magic wand that turns a static website into a dynamic,
        engaging experience.
